Finvenkisto
===========

Ludo por perforte malhelpi homojn krokodili por venigi la finan venkon!

Ĉi tiu ludo estis farita por la LudFesto de nia-esperanto.com
2014/2015.

Vi rolas kiel finvenkisma esperantisto en esperanta evento kaj vi
ĝeniĝas ĉar ĉiu parolas aliajn lingvojn anstataŭ esperanto! Por ripari
la situacion necesas kuri al ĉiu kaj krii ‘NE KROKODILU!!’. Ĉiu kiu
alkriiĝas iĝas verda kiel vera esperantisto. Se vi sukcese
esperantigas ĉiun la fina venko venas kaj la ludo finiĝas.

Ne eblas morti aŭ malsukcesi en la ludo sed vi povas konkursi por havi
la plej rapidan tempon por venigi la finan venkon. Alternative vi
povas inviti amikojn kaj ludi samtempe por vidi kiu povas esperantigi
pli da homoj.

Bonan ŝancon!
